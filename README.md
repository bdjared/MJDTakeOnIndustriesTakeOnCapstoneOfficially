The Paul Miller Parking Manager is an application meant to ease the life of car dealerships, specifically a local car dealership. The application features a login for all employees at the dealership, user and admin profiles based on their job. On the first page, you can see a table of cars with many actions that can be preformed on the car. This action menu includes changing the car's location in the dealership's parking lot, showing it on an image of the dealership's parking lot, viewing details about the car, archiving and deleting the car as well. The map features all of the cars in the lot in their respective spot according to our dealership's lot. Currently, the map feature will only work for the specific dealership we worked with, because the image cannot be uploaded by anyone. All the information about the car can be found on it's own page, and it is also possible to create a QR code which will open a link to all of the stored details about the car.
